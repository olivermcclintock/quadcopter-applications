# Quadcopter-Applications
Quadcopter &amp; Drone Systems with Practical Applications

The MyDearDrone Quadcopter is our major project. Our design utilizes an ARM Cortext-M3 as its MCU via Flymaple, a custom control board. At the top level is a Linux device (probably a router) used for high-level computing and tasks such as camera control and GPS/IRS navigation. 
## Main Roadmap
###### System Diagram

- RF controller (Arduino, a program to control our [best drone](https://mydeardrone.com/) that won't crash it)
- PC or smartphone sensor control
- W-Fi gateway, and advanced automation protocols
- Advanced self-balancing (through some kind of serial interface)
- Simple Android/iOS or PC controller
###### Copter Controller Timeline
- Sensor test
- Motor control

- Autopilot for takeoff
- Autopilot for landing
###### RF Controller Timeline
- PPM remote control
- Remote control based on Arduino
- Remote control combined with motor control
- Smartphone control App
###### Wi-Fi Router
- OpenWrt customization
- TP-Link WR703N video driver
- Router control method
- Combined Wi-Fi router with others' models
## About Flymaple
The Flymaple is our Quadcopter controller, based on Maple Project. It uses an STM32F103RET6 (ARM Cortex-M3) as the main MCU.
###### Features
- 72MHz STM32F103RET6 ARM Cotex-M3 microcontroller (Based on Maple RET6)
- 64KB SRAM
- 512KB FLASH ROM
- ITG3205 3-Axis gyroscope
- ADXL345 3-Axis accelerometer
- HMC5883 3-Axis compass
- BMP085 Barometer
- 3x 6-Channel GPIO, used to control 6-channel ESC/Servo
- 3x 8-Channel GPIO, used to capture RC receiver output
- 2x USART (serial) ports ready for XBee and GPS devices
- 2x I2C interfaces ready for ultrasonic sensor altimeters
- Arduino Shield compatible female head interface (AREF, GND)
- SWD/JTAG debugger compatible
###### Flymaple Pins
**NOTE: On most ARM chips (including the STM32F103), all pins can be treated as General Input/Output (GPIO), and all pins can have another re-defined function.** 
## Remote Control
###### Joystick
A 4-axis joystick is an attractive alternative to pricey RC controllers â€“ especially for amateur hobbyists. You can easily grab the analog input events via jstest, which is bundled with most current GNU/Linux distributions.
The following is output captured from an Xbox controller that was connected to a PC via a USB converter. 
```
root@horizons:/home/sam# apt-get install joystick
...
...
root@horizons:/home/sam# jstest --event /dev/input/js0
Driver version is 2.1.0.
Joystick (Microsoft X-Box pad v2 (US)) has 8 axes (X, Y, Z, Rx, Ry, Rz, Hat0X, Hat0Y)
and 10 buttons (BtnX, BtnY, BtnZ, BtnTL, BtnTR, BtnTL2, BtnThumbL, BtnThumbR, ?, ?).

Not all joysticks can be correctly monitored by the Linux kernel, so your results may vary.

To give one example, although the kernel of Ubuntu-12.04-x64 correctly interprets the button and pad events of my PlayStation2 controller (connected via a USB converter), it fails to translate the analog axis events of the same controller. 
## What is DCM matrix
DCM stands for direction cosine matrix. It is a method for representing a rotation through euler angles. Other methods exist as well, for example quaternion is one of the other methods.
###### Euler angles
The Euler angles are three angles introduced by Leonhard Euler to describe the orientation of a rigid body.
## Test DCM Code
###### Install the Processing IDE and compile the monitor
- Download the Processing IDE
- Uncompress the package and run processing bash script to activate - the Processing IDE 
- Download the code of orientation filtering monitor
- Compile code with Processing IDE
###### Install the SDK for flymaple and compile the orientation filtering code
- Install the command line SDK for flymaple
- Download the flymaple code
- Compile code with make command in the root directory of the flymaple code
###### Upload the firmware to flymaple
- Connect flymaple to your computer through a micro usb cable
- Upload the firmware with make install command in the root directory of the flymaple code
- The reset button of the flymaple should be pressed immediately after you do make install  
###### Test the orientation filtering firmware for flymaple
- Set the flymaple on a horizontal surface and press the reset button of flymaple
- Open the monitor. You will see a 3 dimension cube having the same posture with flymaple
