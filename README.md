# Quadcopter-Applications
Quadcopter &amp; Drone Systems with Engineering Applications

The MyDearDrone Quadcopter is our major project. Our design utilizes an ARM Cortext-M3 as its MCU via Flymaple, a custom control board. At the top level is a Linux device (probably a router) used for high-level computing and tasks such as camera control and GPS/IRS navigation.
